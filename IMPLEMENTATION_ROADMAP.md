- **P2**: Quality improvements, can be done after P1

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Content Migration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Scraping may fail if utulok-trencin.sk structure is complex
   - **Mitigation**: Start with manual scraping of 5 dogs, then automate. Fallback to manual data entry if needed.

2. **CMS Learning Curve**
   - **Risk**: Shelter staff struggle with Decap CMS
   - **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive documentation, video tutorial, and offer ongoing support.

3. **Timeline Pressure**
   - **Risk**: 4-6 weeks may be optimistic
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize P0 tasks, defer nice-to-haves to Phase 2.

### Medium Risk

1. **Free Tier Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Cloudinary/Cloudflare/Form services hit limits
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor usage closely, have upgrade path documented.

2. **Performance on Low-End Devices**
   - **Risk**: Animations/images may lag on old phones
   - **Mitigation**: Test early on real devices, use prefers-reduced-motion.

3. **Social Sharing Issues**
   - **Risk**: Open Graph images don't display correctly
   - **Mitigation**: Test sharing on Facebook/Instagram early, iterate.

### Low Risk

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: Features break on older browsers
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, test on target browsers.

2. **Deployment Issues**
   - **Risk**: Cloudflare Pages deployment fails
   - **Mitigation**: Use well-documented setup, test preview deployments first.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics (Post-Launch)

1. **Performance**
   - Lighthouse Performance Score: 90+ ✅
   - Page Load Time (3G): <2 seconds ✅
   - Time to Interactive: <2.5 seconds ✅

2. **Content**
   - Dog Profiles: 20-40 ✅

---

## Out of Scope (Phase 2)

The following features are intentionally deferred to post-launch:

1. **Payment Processing**
   - Online donations
   - Virtual adoption payments
   - Monthly sponsorships
   - **Why deferred**: Requires legal compliance, payment gateway setup, security considerations

2. **Multi-Language Support**
   - English translation
   - Language switcher
   - **Why deferred**: Low priority for local shelter, can add based on demand

3. **User Accounts**
   - Adopter accounts
   - Volunteer portal
   - Authentication system
   - **Why deferred**: Not needed for MVP, adds complexity

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Mobile app
   - Instagram feed integration
   - Volunteer management system
   - Analytics dashboard for staff
   - **Why deferred**: Nice-to-have, not critical for adoption goals

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Visual regression tests
   - **Why deferred**: Time constraints, manual testing sufficient for MVP
